    <h2>Evolution of HTML Tags</h2>

<p>When HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, there were only 18 tags. These tags were used to define basic elements such as paragraphs, headers, links, and lists.</p>

<p>As the web has evolved, HTML has grown significantly. Today, with HTML5, there are around 140 tags that support multimedia, forms, document structure, and many more modern web needs.</p>

<p>This evolution has made the web more interactive, flexible, and accessible, enabling developers to create dynamic websites with ease.</p>
