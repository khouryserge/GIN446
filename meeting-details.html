        Lebanon has experienced steady growth in internet connectivity, with approximately <strong>84% of the population</strong> connected to the internet as of 2023. However, internet speeds and service availability have faced challenges due to economic conditions and infrastructure limitations.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lebanon has a high rate of social media penetration, with nearly <strong>75% of the population</strong> using platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.</li>
        <li>Despite high internet penetration, Lebanon's <strong>average internet speed</strong> remains lower than the global average due to aging infrastructure and limited investment in network upgrades.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Social Media Statistics in Lebanon</h3>
    <p>
        Social media usage in Lebanon is a major component of internet activity, with a high percentage of users engaging across platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facebook remains the most popular social media platform, with <strong>5.4 million users</strong> in Lebanon, representing a large portion of the population.</li>
        <li>Instagram and WhatsApp are also widely used, with WhatsApp being particularly important for communication due to its low data consumption.</li>

    <h3>5. Challenges and Opportunities in Internet Access</h3>
    <p>
        While internet penetration is high across much of the Middle East, there are still challenges to widespread, equitable access:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Countries such as Yemen, Iraq, and Syria face <strong>infrastructure issues</strong> due to ongoing conflict, making internet access unreliable and slow in certain areas.</li>
        <li>The economic crisis in Lebanon has led to increased <strong>power outages</strong>, which affect internet reliability, although efforts to improve connectivity through solar-powered solutions are being explored.</li>
        <li>Expanding <strong>5G technology</strong> presents significant opportunities for faster internet speeds and better services, particularly in Gulf countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The Middle East, including Lebanon, has seen substantial growth in internet penetration and mobile usage over the past decade. While there are infrastructure challenges, especially in conflict-affected regions, the region's investment in mobile networks and social media usage underscores the internet’s growing importance. In Lebanon, connectivity issues persist, but efforts to improve internet speed and reliability remain crucial for future growth.

    <h2>Evolution of HTML Tags</h2>

<p>When HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, there were only 18 tags. These tags were used to define basic elements such as paragraphs, headers, links, and lists.</p>

<p>As the web has evolved, HTML has grown significantly. Today, with HTML5, there are around 140 tags that support multimedia, forms, document structure, and many more modern web needs.</p>

<p>This evolution has made the web more interactive, flexible, and accessible, enabling developers to create dynamic websites with ease.</p>
